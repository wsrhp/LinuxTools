0.9.2	- NEWS: updated
	(2004/10/28)
	- dos2unix.c: do not clear FT_BINARY flag from fileType when Mac
	line endings are detected which should avoid image or sound (or
	other binary) files to be confused with Mac text files (thanks to
	basic <basic@mozdev.org> and Caj Nordström
	<caj.nordstrom@beamex.com> for pointing out the bug and suggesting
	the fix)

	mistake)
	- INSTALL: added notice about popt-devel as suggested by max
	- install-sh: updated from automake-1.8.3 package
	- Makefile.in: changed '$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $(TARGET) $(TARGET).c
	$(LIBS)' to '$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $(@:%=%.c) $(LIBS)' (based on
	suggestion by Marty Leisner <mleisner@eng.mc.xerox.com>)
	(2004/10/25)
	- ChangeLog, README: fixed typos
	(2004/04/18)
0.9.1	- Makefile.in: 'make cleanall' removes also cache directory created
	by 'autoconf'
	- dos2unix.c: --version (-V) option added: display version
	information
	- configure.in: incorporated changes sugested by configure.scan
	generated by 'autoscan'
	- config.h.in added (as created by 'autoheader')
	- configure.in: config.h is generated by 'configure'
	- Makefile.in: incorporated changes done to configure.in
	- README: added info about --version (-V) option
	(2004/04/14)
0.9.0	- dos2unix.c: files in Mac format are now recognized; thanks to Sam
	Barnum <sbarnum@pointsystems.com> and max
	<max@oddjob.utias.utoronto.ca> for suggestion (and to max also for
	pushing me to actualy do that :)
	- dos2unix.c: new conversion types: MAC -> UNIX, UNIX -> MAC,
	DOS -> MAC and MAC -> DOS
	- dos2unix.c: when autodetected input format does not match input
	format suggested by conversion type option on command line, conversion
	type is automaticaly corrected
	- dos2unix.c: --force (-f) option, which supress above mentioned
	behaviour
	- install-sh: updated from automake-1.6 package
	- README: updated
	- TODO: what should be fixed till next stable release
	(2003/11/14)

0.8.2	- dos2unix.c: read/write buffers implemented - increases performance
	about 9 times
	- dos2unix.c: message "File format '<file>':" changed to
	"File format of '<file>':"
	- TODO: updated
	(2003/10/03)
0.8.1	- dos2unix.c: mkstemp() used instead of tmpnam()
	- dos2unix.c: temporary directory specified by TMPDIR or TMP
	environment variable used; if none of them is avialable, then "/tmp"
	is used
	(2003/02/26)
0.8.0	- ChangeLog: fixed typo
	- README: updated "Usage" chapter
	- dos2unix.c: updated help
	(2002/01/04)

	grammar corrections and miscellaneous beautifying in help & docs)
	(2002/05/07)

0.7.2	- INSTALL: fixed info about changing prefix
	- Makefile.in: create bin directory before installing hd2u binary
	into it; this should solve the problem when using custom prefix
	in which 'bin' directory does not exists (thanks to Emanuele Olivetti
	<olivetti@itc.it> for reporting the problem)
	- dos2unix.c: fix gcc 2.96 warning: string length '687' is greater
	than the minimum length '509' ISO C89 is required to support
	(2002/01/04)
0.7.1	- dos2unix.c: --skipbin (-b) switch added: binary files won't be
	converted
	- dos2unix.c: --test (-t): NO output (not even verbose)
	- dos2unix.c: conversion of input data from stdin works again
	- dos2unix.c: reworked convert(): conversion of input data from stdin works
	again; better separation of detection, verbose info output and other logic
	- dos2unix.c: rouge '\r' are reported but only conversion dos -> unix
	affects them (they are skipped)
	- dos2unix.c: directories when given as input are skipped
	(2001/01/11)
0.7.0	- dos2unix.c: more robust source format detection can detect binary
	files, mixed mode files, and files with no line endings at all
	- dos2unix.c: added automatic skipping of binary files
	- dos2unix.c: added --test mode to check filetype without converting
	- dos2unix.c: added --verbose option to show status messages while
	working
	- dos2unix.c: converted C++ style (//) comments to C style (/**/)
	(some C compilers will choke on //)
	- dos2unix.c: reordered function definition to avoid prototypes
	- dos2unix.c: replaced hard tabs with 4 spaces
	- dos2unix.c: added emacs modeline
	(2001/02/07 - Rob Ginda <rginda@netscape.com>)
