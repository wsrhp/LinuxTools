How to install hd2u
-------------------

First, you need some UNIX system which have some basic C development tools
and popt library alredy installed.

Note: If you're using some package management tool on your system you should
have also installed so called 'development' package of popt library
(popt-dev or popt-devel, etc.) so required header files are also installed.


After you sucessfuly downloaded and unpacked source tarball, do the
following in source directory:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

This will build and install 'dos2unix' into default location,
which is /usr/local/bin .

If you want to use another prefix than /usr/local use for example:

$ ./configure --prefix=/usr

This will install 'dos2unix' into /usr/bin .

For more information use:

$ ./configure --help
