Instalation

To install this package under a Unix derivative, read the INSTALL file.


Usage
-----

	dos2unix [--verbose|-v] [--test|-t] [--force|-f] \
		 [--<x>2<y>|--auto|-<Z>] \
		 [<file name> [...]]

	--auto, -A	output will be set based upon autodetection
			of source format
	--d2u, -U	perform DOS -> UNIX conversion
	--m2u, -T	perform MAC -> UNIX conversion
	--u2d, -D	perform UNIX -> DOS conversion
	--u2m, -M	perform UNIX -> MAC conversion
	--d2m, -O	perform DOS -> MAC conversion
	--m2d, -C	perform MAC -> DOS conversion

	--force		suppress internal conversion type corrections
			based on autodetected input format
	--skipbin, -b	skip binary files
	--test, -t	don't write any conversion results; usefull with
			--verbose to just report on source type
	--verbose, -v	print extra information on stderr
	--version, -V	print version information on stderr

When no options are given then input format will be automatically detected
and converted as follows:

	DOS -> UNIX
	MAC -> UNIX
	UNIX -> DOS

Same as above applies if --auto option is used.

When no file is given, then stdin is used as input and stdout as output.

When concrete conversion type is used (--d2u or --u2d option) and file
format is autodetected as target format, file is skipped - not touched - so
there is no modification time change.

Binary files will be skipped automatically if option --skipbin (or -b) is
used.

Stray '\r' characters (without a following '\n') are reported but only
conversion 'DOS -> Unix' affects them (they are skipped).

You can display usage information using 'dos2unix -h' or 'dos2unix --help'.

Examples:

- this converts README.txt into DOS format; if README.txt is in UNIX format,
it is converted otherwise it will be unchanged:

	dos2unix --u2d README.txt

- this is obvious:

	cat source_in_UNIX_format.txt | dos2unix > result_in_DOS_format.txt

- this will just "copy" source.txt to unchanged_source.txt:

	cat source.txt | dos2unix | dos2unix > unchanged_source.txt

- this will convert all .txt files in current directory into UNIX format,
all documents in UNIX format and all binary files are skipped, verbose
information will be displayed:

	dos2unix -Ubv *.txt
