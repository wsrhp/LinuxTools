hd2u 0.9.2
----------

In this release issues with some binary files being recognized as text files
in Macintosh format should be resolved. Also documentation has been enhanced
and some typos in it fixed.


Peter Hanecak <hanecak@megaloman.sk>


hd2u 0.9.1
----------

New --version (-V) option has been added to display version information and
build process has been enhanced.


Peter Hanecak <hanecak@megaloman.sk>


hd2u 0.9.0
----------

This release starts development period. Most notable change is addition of
support for Macintosh text format.


Peter Hanecak <hanecak@megaloman.sk>


hd2u 0.8.2
----------

This release introduces read/write buffers which increases conversion
performance about 9 times.


Peter Hanecak <hanecak@megaloman.sk>


hd2u 0.8.1
----------

Temporary files are now created in directory defined by TMPDIR or TMP
environment variable. If no such variable is found, '/tmp' directory is
used. Also security has been enhanced by usage of 'mkstemp()' instead of
'tmpnam()'.

hd2u 0.7.1
----------

In this release, there are following changes:

1) convert() is reworked so it always "caches" input into tempfile (even
when no conversion is done *). This makes dos2unix able to convert data from
stdin again. Also scan/detect code has been separated from logic (conversion
type selection) and verbose output. Also every conversion type (dos -> unix,
unix -> dos, copy) has now its own optimised loop.

2) From above changes comes some performance issues (I do not know if anyone
cares about them, but still I'm going to write about it):
	- conversion of big files should be faster (optimised loops for each
	conversion)
	- conversion of a lot of files should be slower (while there is full
	input scan and more logic)
	- even when just testing (--test and --verbose, --test alone makes
	just file reads without any output) temporary file is used to store
	input - this is because I did not wanted to slow scan with condition 
	'if (!testmode)' on each 'fputc()' thus slowing conversion; I think
	test will be used much less then conversions

3) As opposed to version 0.7.0, binary files are skipped only when --skipbin
or -b option is used. I'm from Slovakia and our charset uses codes above
126 thus all our conversion which uses dos2unix 0.7.0 wont work on such
files. So to maintain some backward compatibility from now binary files will
be detected but not skipped by default.

By the way, if you are using 'dos2unix *' you should be VERY CAREFULL!!! It's
something like 'rm -rf .' if missused. So 'dos2unix *.txt *.c *.h doc/*.html'
would be far better (even if not that comfortable).

4) Rouge '\r' characters (DOS format line breaks with missing '\n' after
them) are now reported but affected only by 'dos -> unix' conversion - they
are skipped.

5) If you give directory as input file to 'dos2unix' it will be skipped (I
have better no idea what it was doing untill now).

hd2u 0.7.0
----------

This is development release based on changes from Rob Ginda
<rginda@netscape.com> which breaks conversion functionality when converting
data from stdin. So users which requires proper functionality of stdin
conversion should continue to use version 0.6.0 (or earlier) and wait for
fixed version to be released (or make a fix for themselves - in such case I
would be happy to receive that fix :).
